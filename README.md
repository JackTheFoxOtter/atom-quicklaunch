# Quicklaunch

Allows to launch any file in your project hierarchy through a terminal window.
Terminal applications will launch inside the terminal, GUI applications will launch as usual with the terminal showing possible console output of the application.

# Usage

Simply right-click the item in the project tree-view and hit "Run" in the context menu, right-click into any open text editor and click "Run" in the context menu or navigate to "Packages>Quicklaunch>Run active". Alternatively the default shortcut "alt-r" will have the same effect.
